# News-Headline-Sarcasm-Detection


<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>I developed a machine learning model to detect sarcasm in news headlines. Using Python and Keras, I built a neural network with an embedding layer, LSTM layer, dropout layer, and a dense output layer. I preprocessed the data through tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming, then trained and evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The project enhanced my skills in NLP and deep learning, showcasing my ability to solve real-world problems with machine learning.</p>
